Starting with an input string of words, find the second-to-last word of the string.
For example, an input of “I love you” should return “love.”

To make your program more challenging,
allow for a second numerical input, n,
that results in returning the nth word of a string.
So, for the string “I can program in Java” and n = 3,
the output should be the third word, “program.”

#TODO

1. Create a Scanner for user input
2. Save the user input in a string
3. Divide the string by words
4. Create a function to print the second-to-last word of the string
